{"cells":[{"source":"![A car dashboard with lots of new technical features.](images/dashboard.jpg)\n\nYou're working for a well-known car manufacturer who is looking at implementing LLMs into vehicles to provide guidance to drivers. You've been asked to experiment with integrating car manuals with an LLM to create a context-aware chatbot. They hope that this context-aware LLM can be hooked up to a text-to-speech software to read the model's response aloud.\n\nAs a proof of concept, you'll integrate several pages from a car manual that contains car warning messages and their meanings and recommended actions. This particular manual, stored as an HTML file, `mg-zs-warning-messages.html`, is from an MG ZS automobile, a compact SUV. Armed with your newfound knowledge of LLMs and LangChain, you'll implement Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to create the context-aware chatbot.\n\n**Note: Although we'll be using the OpenAI API in this project, you do not need to specify an API key.**","metadata":{},"id":"f2edba47-9e2e-476e-9f2f-fb177b329063","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Run this cell to install the necessary
